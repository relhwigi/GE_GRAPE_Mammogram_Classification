# Experiments
## Overview
To improve my results I conducted experiments in which I tweaked the hyperpa- rameters and grammar I used until I arrived at the implementation in ../main notebooks/Machine_Learning_using_GE_Mammography_Classification.ipynb. Through the following experiments I was able to increase my accuracy from to 54.9% to 66.6%. The first three experiments (exp-1.ipynb, exp-2.ipynb, exp-3.ipynb) use the initial grammar I produced while the remaining use the final grammar.
