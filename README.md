# Grammatical Evolution Mammogram Classification using the GRAPE Library
## Overview
The aim of the project is to use Grammatical Evolution (GE) to develop classifiers for mammograms to predict whether a mammogram contains cancerous growth. More specifically, using several thousand mammograms, it predicts whether a segment of the mammogram contains cancerous growth. The classification of each segment will result in the presence or the absence of a suspicious region, therefore, making this a binary classification issue and the resulting program a stage 1 Computer Aided Detection (CAD) system.

## Layout
data: The data folder contains the data files that were used for this implementation.
experiments: The experiments folder contains multiple notebooks of different parameter tuning experiments that were carried out.
grammars: The grammars folder contains two different grammars that were used for the implementation.
main notebooks: The main notebooks folder contains the main implementation notebooks that are separate to the experiments.
